        <p>Throughout my professional life I have always endeavoured to complete my work with enthusiasm, efficiency and attention to detail. I have worked predominantly within an agency environment and have therefore learned the importance of taking constructive criticism in order to become the strongest possible member of my team.</p>
        <p>I work especially well under the pressure of tight deadlines and, consequently, I can respond flexibly and intelligently to the ever-changing demands of a project. My co-workers would describe me as personable, dependable and passionate about the work I produce. As a result of this dedication, I consistently take time outside of work to improve my abilities beyond what is required of me.</p>
